### Animator

Animator is an iOS SDK for visual search recommendations in fashion. Animator SDK provided by Streamoid Technologies lets you seemlessly integrate visual search feature into your native iOS applications.

- what is visual search in fashion ?
- That perfect summer dress you saw in a magazine or those shoes that the woman was wearing at the coffee shop this morning. Just take a photo and find similar products in your app using Animator SDK.

### Installation

Animator can be installed directly into your application by importing a framework or via CocoaPods. Quick installation instructions are provided below for reference.

##### CocoaPods Installation:

The recommended path for installation is CocoaPods. CocoaPods provides a simple, versioned dependency management system that automates the tedious and error prone aspects of manually configuring libraries and frameworks. You can add Animator to your project via CocoaPods by doing the following :

```sh
$ sudo gem install cocoapods
$ pod setup
```
Now create a Podfile in the root of your project directory and add the following:
```sh
pod 'Streamoid-Animator'
```
Complete the installation by executing:
```sh
$ pod install
```
These instructions will setup your local CocoaPods environment and import Animator into your project. Once this has completed, test your installation by referring to the Verifying Animator Configuration section below.

##### Framework Installation
Download the appropriate build artifact from this repository and add it to your application:

- Drag and drop the framework onto your project, instructing Xcode to copy items into your destination group's folder.
- Add run script phase to build phase: 
- Go to "Build Phase" section of your target settings.
- Click on the + button in the top left and select New Run Script Phase.
- In the script text input box paste the following snippet:

``` bash ${SRCROOT}/Animator.framework/strip-framework.sh```

Build and run your project to verify installation was successful. Once you have completed a successful build, refer to the Verifying Animator Configuration section below for details on how to test your setup.

### Configuration
- Disable App Transport Security(ATS) to support http : 
- In iOS9 and Xcode 7, Apple requires that all network connections use https. This will block some of the http connections we are making inside framework. So, the following must be added to your info.plist file to support http connections:
```sh 
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
<key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
<true/>
</dict>
```
- Enable permission to support camera : 
- In iOS10 and Xcode 8, Apple requires permission to use came and photo library. So, the following must be added to your info.plist filte to use camera and photo library:
```sh 
<key>Privacy - Camera Usage Description</key>
<value>Uses Camera </value>

```

### Verifying Animator Configuration

Once you have finished installing Animator via CocoaPods or framework, you can test your configuration by importing the headers and connecting a client to the Animator cloud. To do so, edit your view controller   to include the code below (note that you must substitute the client name and client token placeholder text with your actual values, in order to get these values please contact us at support@streamoid.com):

```sh
#import <Animator/Animator.h>

- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions
{
[Animator initializeWithClientName:CLIENT_NAME andClientToken:CLIENT_TOKEN];
}
```
Launch your application and verify that the connection is successful. You are now ready to begin visual search.
